# jetpack-tiled-gallery-with-modaal

This plugin replaces the need for Jetpack when needing their mosaic gallery. We didn't like the full-screen carousel, so we replaced it with [Modaal](http://www.humaan.com/modaal/).

*NOTE* This plugin does not include Modaal. You will want to include that yourself. We utilize it throughout our themes, so didn't need duplicate copies or the complexity of checking whether it was already installed or not.
